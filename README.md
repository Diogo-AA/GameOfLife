# GameOfLife

This project simulates the Game of Life and allows the user to control the simulation.

## Description

This repository contains the implementation of the famous Game of Life of John Conway in C++. 
This game simulates the evolution of cells on a two-dimensional grid based on a set of simple rules.
This program allows users to interact with the game, pause it, resume it, and adjust the simulation speed.
More features are on the way.

The Game of Life in this program can be controlled as follows:
* Pause/Resume: You can pause and resume the game simulation by pressing the "p" key.
* Adjusting Speed: You can increase or decrease the simulation speed using the "w" and "s" keys.
